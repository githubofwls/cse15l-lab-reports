"cd" command with no arguments:
  -working directory: perl5
  -I got a blank output because I didn't specify which directory I wanted to change to.
  -The output isn't an error because I didn't specify which directory I wanted to change to.
"ls" command with no arguments:
  -working directory: perl5
  -I got the output "perl5" because that's the current directory that I'm in.
  -The output isn't an error.
"cat" command with no arguments:
  -working directory: perl5
  -I got a blank output because I didn't specify which file(s) I wanted to concatenate.

"cd" command with a path to a directory as an argument:
  -working directory: wavelet
  -I got no output, but the text before typing my future commands now included "wavelet" in it.
  -The output isn't an error, because upon successfully changing directories, there is no official output (just the directory name showing in the text before typing future commands).
"ls" command with a path to a directory as an argument:
  -working directory: wavelet
  -I got the output "ls: cannot access wavelet: No such file or directory" because you're not supposed to enter any arguments.
  -The output isn't an error because I incorrectly entered an argument.
"cat" command with a path to a directory as an argument:
  -working directory: wavelet
  -I got the output "cat: wavelet: No such file or directory" because you're supposed to specify which file(s) you want to have concatenated.
  -The output isn't an error because I didn't specify which file(s) I wanted to have concatenated.
